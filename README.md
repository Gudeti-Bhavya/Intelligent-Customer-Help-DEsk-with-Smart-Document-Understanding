Category : Artificial  Intelligence

1. Project  Summary :
    In  this  project, we  use  the  typical  customer  care  chatbot  experience, but  instead  of  relying  on  pre-determined  responses, the  dialog  provides  a  hook  that   can  call  out  to  other  IBM  Watson  services  for  additional  sources  of  information. In  this  case, its  an  owner  manual  that  has  been  uploaded  to  Watson  Discovery.

2. Project  Requirements :
i) Create  a  customer  care  dialog  skill  in  Watson  Assistant.
ii) Smart  Document  Understanding (SDU)  to  build  an  enhanced  Watson  Discovery  collection.
iii) Create  an  IBM  Cloud  functions  web  action  that  allows  Watson  Assistant  to  post  queries  to  Watson  discovery.
iv) Build  a  web  application  with  integration  to  all  these  services  and  deploy  the  same  on  IBM  Cloud  Platform.

3. Functional  Requirements:
step-1: The  data  source  from  external  is  annotated  by  using  Watson  Discovery
